abstract = {In this work, radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is applied to emulate an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in a data assimilation scenario. The dynamical model studied here is based on the one-dimensional shallow water equation DYNAMO-1D. This code is simple when compared with an operational primitive equation models for numerical weather prediction. Although simple, the DYNAMO-1D is rich for representing some atmospheric motions, such as Rossby and gravity waves. It has been shown in the literature that the ability of the EKF to track nonlinear models depends on the frequency and accuracy of the observations and model errors. In some cases, just fourth-order moment EKF works well, but will be unwieldy when applied to high-dimensional state space. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an alternative solution for this computational complexity problem, once the ANN is trained offline with a high order Kalman filter, even though this Kalman filter has high computational cost (which is not a problem during ANN training phase). The results achieved in this work encourage us to apply this technique on operational model. However, it is not yet possible to assure convergence in high dimensional problems.}

abstract = {This work studies reduced order modeling (ROM) approaches to speed up the solution of variational data assimilation problems with large scale nonlinear dynamical models. It is shown that a key requirement for a successful reduced order solution is that reduced order Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions accurately represent their full order counterparts. In particular, accurate reduced order approximations are needed for the forward and adjoint dynamical models, as well as for the reduced gradient. New strategies to construct reduced order based are developed for proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) ROM data assimilation using both Galerkin and Petrov–Galerkin projections. For the first time POD, tensorial POD, and discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) are employed to develop reduced data assimilation systems for a geophysical flow model, namely, the two dimensional shallow water equations. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical framework for Galerkin projection. In the case of Petrov–Galerkin projection, stabilization strategies must be considered for the reduced order models. The new reduced order shallow water data assimilation system provides analyses similar to those produced by the full resolution data assimilation system in one tenth of the computational time.}

This chapter provides a review of current operational practice and of advanced data assimilation techniques in meteorology. Numerical models can be used to assimilate meteorological and oceanographic data, creating a dynamically consistent, complete and accurate “movie” of the two geofluids, atmosphere, and ocean in motion. The ocean's strong stratification helps determine the most energetic scales and processes for the global ocean circulation. Active research on data assimilation is burgeoning rapidly in both meteorology and oceanography. Operational NWP requirements have produced a mature data-assimilation technology in meteorology, from which climatic research has benefitted as well. Ocean is characterized by transient, energetic motions with a broad spectrum in frequency and wave number. A steady component of the circulation may not even exist, and be only a model resulting from the analysis of data sets sparse in space and time, like hydrographic data sets, for which steadiness is assumed a priori. Thus, in oceanic data-assimilation problems, the choice of a model and related data assimilation scheme and the definition of success of the assimilation process itself depend crucially on the scientific issue of interest as the starting point.}
