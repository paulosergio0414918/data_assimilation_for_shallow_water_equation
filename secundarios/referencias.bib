    abstract = { In this paper we propose a novel way to integrate time-evolving partial differential equations that contain nonlinear advection and stiff linear operators, combining exponential integration techniques and semi-Lagrangian methods. The general formulation is built from the solution of an integration factor problem with respect to the problem written with a material derivative, so that the exponential integration scheme naturally incorporates the nonlinear advection. Semi-Lagrangian techniques are used to treat the dependence of the exponential integrator on the flow trajectories. The formulation is general, as many exponential integration techniques could be combined with different semi-Lagrangian methods. This formulation allows an accurate solution of the linear stiff operator, a property inherited by the exponential integration technique. It also provides a sufficiently accurate representation of the nonlinear advection, even with large time-step sizes, a property inherited by the semi-Lagrangian method. Aiming for application in weather and climate modeling, we discuss possible combinations of well-established exponential integration techniques and state-of-the-art semi-Lagrangian methods used operationally in the application. We show experiments for the planar rotating shallow water equations. When compared to traditional exponential integration techniques, the experiments reveal that the coupling with semi-Lagrangian allows stabler integration with larger time-step sizes. From the application perspective, which already uses semi-Lagrangian methods, the exponential treatment could improve the solution of wave dispersion when compared to semi-implicit schemes. }

abstract = {Shallow-water models are often adopted as an intermediate step in the development of atmosphere and ocean models, though they are usually tested only with fluid depths relevant to barotropic fluids. Here we investigate numerical instabilities emerging in shallow-water models considering small fluid depths, which are relevant for baroclinic fluids. Different numerical instabilities of similar nature are investigated. The first one is due to the adoption of the vector-invariant form of the momentum equations, related to what is known as the Hollingsworth instability. We provide examples of this instability with finite-volume and finite-element schemes used in modern quasi-uniform spherical-grid-based models. The second is related to an energy conserving form of discretization of the Coriolis term in finite-difference schemes on latitude–longitude global models. Simple test cases with shallow fluid depths are proposed as a means of capturing and predicting stability issues that can appear in three-dimensional models using only two-dimensional shallow-water codes.},

	abstract = {In this work we have described the application of a machine learning strategy to compute the interface curvature in the context of a Front-Tracking framework. Based on angular information of normal and tangential vectors between marker points, the interface curvature is predicted using a neural network. The Front-Tracking-Machine-Learning method is validated using a sine wave and then applied in combination with a Marker-And-Cell method for solving a complex free surface flow. Our results indicate that it is feasible to employ machine learning concepts as an alternative approach for computing curvatures in Front-Tracking schemes.}
